    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Any type of biryani consists of four main components: rice, meat, marinade, and spices. When it comes to making biryani rice, basmati rice is typically the go-to option; however, some cooks prefer to use other grains, such as jeerakasala or seeraga samba.

        Regional differences are prominently shown in the types of meat used in the dish. Coastal regions of India, for example, are more likely to produce dishes such as shrimp biryani because the resource is easily available. Regions without easy sea access, on the other hand, typically create lamb biryani or chicken biryani, taking full advantage of the resources on hand to craft a delicious local variant. Each type of meat is placed in a yogurt-based marinade to absorb as much flavor as possible, and then herbs and spices are added during the cooking process to finish off this wonderfully simple yet scrumptious recipe. While the spices may vary, the best restaurants, such as Denverâ€™s best Indian restaurant and lunch buffet, Little India, use traditional Indian spices to add a touch of authenticity.</p>
